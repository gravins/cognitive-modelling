#Cognitive modelling framework for Probabilistic and Distance based approaches.

The Distance based approach implements the theory that the people to identify members of a given category compare the given instance with the examples in their memory, and the most similar category is returned.

The Probabilistic approach implements the theory that people reason based on the laws of logic, and handle uncertainty according to probability theory.
